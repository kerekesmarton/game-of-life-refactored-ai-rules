# Core Principles

These foundational principles guide all code quality decisions. For detailed detection and fixing strategies, see `code-quality-guide.mdc`.

## Foundational Principles

### KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Write code that's easy to understand
- Remove unnecessary complexity

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Remove code duplication
- Each piece of knowledge should have a single representation
- See: Duplicated Code in code-quality-guide.mdc

### YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
- Implement only what's needed now
- Delete speculative code
- See: Speculative Generality in code-quality-guide.mdc

### Tell, Don't Ask
- Objects should manage their own state
- Don't ask for data and act on it - tell objects what to do
- See: Feature Envy in code-quality-guide.mdc

### SOLID Principles
- **SRP**: Single Responsibility Principle
- **OCP**: Open Closed Principle
- **LSP**: Liskov Substitution Principle
- **DI**: Dependency Inversion Principle
- **IS**: Interface Segregation Principle

## Quality Assurance Process

### During Development
1. **[Write Tests](testing.mdc)** using TDD when it makes sense, otherwise write unit and integration tests
2. **Format code** consistently
3. **Delete dead code** immediately
4. **Extract constants** from magic numbers/strings
5. **Refine scope** for variables and statements

### During Code Review
1. **Regular reviews** for smell patterns
2. **Test coverage** check before refactoring
3. **Refactoring triggers** - address smells when touching code

### During Refactoring
1. **Do not make changes to production code without proper test coverage**
2. **Incremental improvement** - fix smells gradually
3. **Measure impact** - ensure refactoring improves maintainability
4. **Maintain tests** - keep tests green throughout

## Application Strategy

For detailed code quality checks with ROI ratings and specific detection/fixing strategies, see **[code-quality-guide.mdc](code-quality-guide.mdc)**.

### Priority Order
1. **Critical Issues (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐)** - Fix immediately during active development
2. **High Priority (⭐⭐⭐⭐)** - Fix when touching related code
3. **Medium Priority (⭐⭐⭐)** - Apply when beneficial during refactoring
4. **Low Priority (⭐⭐)** - Address opportunistically
5. **Questionable Rules (⭐)** - Avoid or use as warning signs only

### Key Principles
- Use judgment - rules are guidelines, not absolutes
- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Avoid premature optimization or over-abstraction
- Balance decomposition with readability

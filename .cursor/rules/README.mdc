# Conway's Game of Life - Development Rules Overview

This workspace follows a comprehensive set of development rules based on cost-benefit analysis and practical experience. The rules are organized into focused, non-duplicative modules that work together to maintain high code quality.

---

## Rule Organization

### Core Rules (Always Applied)

1. **[core-principles.mdc](core-principles.mdc)** - Foundational principles and quality processes
   - KISS, DRY, YAGNI, Tell Don't Ask, SOLID
   - Quality assurance processes for development, review, and refactoring
   - Application strategy with priority order

2. **[code-quality-guide.mdc](code-quality-guide.mdc)** - Comprehensive code quality reference
   - ROI-based prioritization (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ to ⭐)
   - Detection and fixing strategies for all code smells
   - Unified guide covering code smells, object calisthenics, and complexity issues
   - **This is the authoritative source for WHAT to look for and fix**

3. **[testing.mdc](testing.mdc)** - Testing strategy and TDD guidance
   - Testing strategy for existing code (characterization, golden master, model-based, property-based)
   - Testing strategy for new features (TDD, unit tests, integration tests)
   - Transformation Priority Premises for TDD implementation

4. **[refactoring.mdc](refactoring.mdc)** - Refactoring workflow and when/how guidance
   - Core refactoring rules (safety first, follow principles, ROI-driven)
   - When to refactor (before features, during review, opportunistically)
   - How to refactor (identify, test, increment, verify)
   - Design principles (cohesion, coupling, balance)
   - **This is the guide for WHEN and HOW to refactor**

---

## How to Use These Rules

1. **Starting Development**: Review [core-principles.mdc](core-principles.mdc) for foundational principles
2. **Writing Code**: Follow [testing.mdc](testing.mdc) for test-driven development
3. **Code Review**: Use [code-quality-guide.mdc](code-quality-guide.mdc) to identify issues by ROI
4. **Refactoring**: Follow [refactoring.mdc](refactoring.mdc) workflow with [code-quality-guide.mdc](code-quality-guide.mdc) as reference

## Quality Gates

- All tests must pass before committing
- No linting errors
- Critical code quality issues (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐) addressed
- Documentation updated for public interfaces

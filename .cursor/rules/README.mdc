# Conway's Game of Life - Development Rules Overview

This workspace follows a comprehensive set of development rules based on cost-benefit analysis and practical experience. The rules are organized into focused modules that work together to maintain high code quality.

## Rule Organization

### Core Rules (Always Applied)
- **[code-principles.mdc]** - Core principles for all development
- **[testing.mdc](testing.mdc)** - Testing strategy for new development and adding new code before refactoring alike.
- **[refactoring.mdc](refactoring.mdc)** - Refactoring rules with ROI analysis
- **[code-quality-guide.mdc](code-quality-guide.mdc)** - Code quality guide with ROI-based priorities (unified code smells and object calisthenics)

## Quality Gates
- All tests must pass before committing
- No linting errors
- Documentation updated for public interfaces
